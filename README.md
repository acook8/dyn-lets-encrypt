# dyn-lets-encrypt
Scripts to automate dns challenges in Certify The Web for Windows and Certbot for Linux

## Background
I built this  that would work allow interaction with the Dyn DNS API, and one that would work on both Windows and Linux. I could have done it in either Powershell or Python, but I wanted to avoid installing language runtimes on servers if possible. I had been looking for an exuse to learn Go so I decided this was a great opportunity. One advantage of Go is you can compile it for a variety of operating systems and architectures. And the runtime is included in the single executable created, so no languages have to be installed.
